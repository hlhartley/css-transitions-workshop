# css-transitions-workshop

## To get started:

* Clone down the file with this command in terminal:

` git clone https://github.com/relasine/css-transitions-workshop.git `

* cd into the directory css-transitions-workshop
* open it in your text editor
* open index.html in your browser

The JavaScript for this has been written, so you don't need to worry about that at all. We'll just be focusing on the CSS for this.

We will:
* Apply transitions to hover effects
* Apply transitions to elements that are undergoing dynamic class assignment
* Utilize position: absolute, transform: rotate, and color changes
* Create a key frames animation (maybe)

If you have questions or would like to pair on transitions or animations, please feel free to hit me up on Slack!
